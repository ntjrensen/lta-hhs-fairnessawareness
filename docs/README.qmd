## 🎓 About {#about}

This project is a template for creating a **fairness analysis of students' progression in educational institutions in The Netherlands**. The template is based on the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup> framework and uses the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup> coding standard. The template is developed by the [Learning Technology & Analytics (LTA)](https://www.dehaagsehogeschool.nl/onderzoek/lectoraten/learning-technology-analytics){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup> research group of The Hague University of Applied Sciences for the [Npuls CEDA](https://community-data-ai.npuls.nl/groups/view/44d20066-53a8-48c2-b4e9-be348e05d273/project-center-for-educational-data-analytics-ceda){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup> project project.

## 🚀 Getting started {#getting-started}

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing. See the [deployment](#deployment) for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To start working with this project, make sure you have the following software installed following the links provided:

**R, Rstudio, Quarto, XQuartz (for Mac only)**

-   RStudio version 2024.12.0 or higher with R version 4.4.2 or higher - [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup>
-   XQuartz 2.8.5 or higher (for Mac only) - [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup>
-   Quarto version 1.6.39 or higher - [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup>. Since we use the latest Quarto functionalities, you will need at least this version.

**Github, GitHub Desktop**

-   A Github account and (optionally) GitHub Desktop version 3.4.16 - [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup>

**GFortran**

-   GFortran - [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup>. Installation will take several minutes.

**R packages, fonts**

-   All other packages are installed automatically by running the project `_Setup.R` file on your local machine. Instructions are below.
-   The installation of the Liter font is optional. Follow the instructions from Google to install this font. - [Google](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Liter){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup>

### Installing {#installing}

1.  First, make a fork of the repository to your own Github account. Then clone the repository to your local machine using for instance GitHub Desktop. See [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup> for an explanation.
2.  Once you have cloned the repository, open the project in RStudio and run the `_Setup.R` file by clicking on `Source`. Don't change any settings yet. This action will install all the necessary packages and fonts. This installation process will take about 5-10 minutes.
3.  Ignore any inline suggestions at the top of R Studio to install missing packages. Click on `Don't show again`
4.  When presented with the following question, choose 1.

```plaintext
It looks like you've called renv::restore() in a project that hasn't been activated yet.
How would you like to proceed? 

1: Activate the project and use the project library.
2: Do not activate the project and use the current library paths.
3: Cancel and resolve the situation another way.
```

5.  Your session will restart. Tun the `_Setup.R` file by clicking on `Source`.
6.  Answer all questions about installations with Yes (Y).

## 📚 Rendering your first fairness reports

### Render the `_advanced-report` using the default settings {#render-the-_advanced-report-using-the-default-settings}

First, run the `_advanced-report` using the default settings. 

-   To start with, you will create an extended report for The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS) with the default settings. It contains detailed information about the fairness analysis: prediction models, R-code and an explanation of each step with references.

**To render the report, follow these steps:**

Since the template has several dependencies, you must render the pages using the terminal. Do not render the pages using the Render button within RStudio.

1.  Open a terminal in RStudio (second tab at the bottom of your screen).
2.  Run the following command for the \_advanced-report:

``` r
quarto render --profile advanced-report
```

3.  The first time this report is generated, the process may take 5–10 minutes. This is normal—please do not interrupt it and allow it to complete.
4.  The report is based on synthesized data from the bachelor's Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD), and will be created in the `_advanced-report` folder of your project. Once finished, click on `_advanced-report/index.html` and choose `View in Web Browser`.
5.  If you don't see this file, click the refresh icon at the top right of the folder. If you still don't see the report, check the console for errors.
6.  When you rerun the report, the output will be removed and a new report will be created. If you want to keep the previously rendered output, copy the entire folder to a location outside of your project.

### Render the `_basic-report` project using the default settings

Next, run the `_basic-report` using the default settings. 

-   Again, you will create a report for The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS) with the default settings. The report is based on synthesized data from the bachelor's Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD), and will be created in the `_basic-report` folder of your project.

**To render the report, follow these steps:**

Since the template has several dependencies, you must render the pages using the terminal. Do not render the pages using the Render button within RStudio.

1.  Open a terminal in RStudio (second tab at the bottom of your screen).
2.  Run the following command for the *basic* report:

``` r
quarto render --profile basic-report
```

3.  The first time this report is generated, the process may take about 5 minutes. This is normal—please do not interrupt it and allow it to complete.
4.  Once the rendering has finished, click on `_basic-report/index.html` and choose `View in Web Browser`. The report will open in your default browser.
5.  If you don't see this file, click the refresh icon at the top right of the folder. If you still don't see the report, check the console for any errors.
6.  When you rerun the report, the output will be removed and a new report will be created. If you want to keep the previously rendered output, copy the entire folder to a location outside of your project.
7.  This report uses the freeze option, which means htmls items will be saved, unless one of your sources files change. This will save you time, when you rerender the report. Freeze files are stored in the `_freeze` folder. If you want to start fresh, simply remove the `_freeze` folder.


### Create and render your institutional reports

Finally, you can create your institutional report by changing the settings in the `_quarto.yml` file.

-   You can change the settings for the layout, the educational institution, faculty or academy, the study program, the report's version, the success factors, the model, the use of synthetic data, the recreation of plots, the enrollment selection and the includes.
-   Start small and work your way up to more complex settings.
-   Follow the [Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) to learn how to create and render your institutional reports.

## 🏁 Deployment {#deployment}

The reports are created in the `_basic` and `advanced` folders. You can deploy the reports to a web server or share them with others by copying the folder to a location outside your project. You can also share the reports by uploading them to a web server or by using a service like GitHub Pages.

## 🔨 Built with {#built-with}

-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup> - The web framework used with R.
-   [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup> - The R coding standard used.
-   [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup> - The R package used to build the prediction models.
-   [Dalex](https://dalex.drwhy.ai/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup> - The R package used to explain the prediction models and create the fairness analysis. The implementation of the fairness analysis is based on the [Fairness](https://fairness.drwhy.ai/){target="_blank"} <sup>🔗</sup> package.

The LTA-HHs team adjusted the Dalex implementation to improve usability and make it suitable for use in the educational sector in the Netherlands.
